# Comprehensive Data Analysis and Visualization of COVID-19 Statistics

## Project Overview

This project involves the comprehensive analysis and visualization of COVID-19 statistics. The objective is to explore trends, correlations, and patterns in the data, providing insights into the global impact of the pandemic. Using Python libraries such as **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**, the project performs data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and generates complex visualizations.

## Features

- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Handled missing values, corrected data types, and prepared the dataset for analysis.
  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identified key trends, correlations, and patterns within the dataset using Pandas and NumPy.

- **Complex Visualizations**: Created a variety of visualizations, including line plots, bar charts, histograms, and heatmaps using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

- **Custom Algorithms**: Implemented a simple moving average algorithm to analyze trends and forecast future COVID-19 case numbers.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language used for data analysis and visualization.
  
- **Pandas**: Utilized for data manipulation, cleaning, and exploratory data analysis.
  
- **NumPy**: Used for numerical operations and custom algorithm development.

- **Matplotlib**: Employed for generating visualizations such as line plots, bar charts, and histograms.

- **Seaborn**: Used to create advanced visualizations like heatmaps and enhance the overall aesthetic of the plots.

## Dataset

The project uses a publicly available COVID-19 dataset, which includes information on confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries from various countries. The dataset is downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/imdevskp/corona-virus-report).

## Key Insights

- **Trend Analysis**: The project reveals the trends of COVID-19 spread across different countries and identifies the nations most affected by the pandemic.

- **Correlation Analysis**: The correlation matrix provides insights into the relationships between confirmed cases, deaths, recoveries, and daily new cases.

- **Forecasting**: The simple moving average method helps in forecasting future trends, providing a basic understanding of potential case numbers.
